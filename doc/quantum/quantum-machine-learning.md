"A conclusion from the above results and the answers to the research questions is that the hope for exponential advantages of quantum algorithms for machine learning over their classical counterparts might be misplaced"

[Probabilistic Graphical Models and Tensor Networks: A Hybrid Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15666.pdf)


"We investigate a correspondence between two formalisms for discrete probabilistic modeling: probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and tensor networks (TNs), a powerful modeling framework for simulating complex quantum systems."
